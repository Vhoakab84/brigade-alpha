Brigade Alpha
=============

Welcome to the [new Brigade website](http://codeforamerica..org/brigade).

We have a few main goals with this website:

1. Clearly explain what the Brigade is.
2. Show off the activities and stories of the Brigades.
3. Make it easy to find a local Brigade.
4. Make it easy to join a Brigade.

Tech
----
This site is built with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP.

The data about the Brigades will is from the [Civic Tech Movement API](http://civic-tech-movement.codeforamerica.org/). The work on that project is happening under the [civic-json-worker](https://github.com/codeforamerica/civic-json-worker) repository.
